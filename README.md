
FileServer is based on NodeJS,a static file server.

You can edit `config.js` to set configuration,then run `node app.js` in terminal.  

The `assets` folder is root directory,you can drop any file or folder in it and via url to get it.Of course, you can modify the root directory in profile.

That's all,enjoy it!
